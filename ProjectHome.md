DeDe is a very fast program that can analize executables compiled with Delphi 3,4,5,6, C++Builder and Kylix and give you the following:

> - All dfm files of the target. You will be able to open and edit them with Delphi
> - All published methods in well commented ASM code with references to strings, imported function calls, classes methods calls, components in the unit, Try-Except and Try-Finally blocks. By default DeDe retreives only the published methods sources, but you may also process another procedure in a executable if you know the RVA offset using the Tools|Disassemble Proc menu
> - A lot of additional information.
> - You can create a Delphi project folder with all dfm, pas, dpr files. Note: pas files contains the mentioned above well commented ASM code. They can not be recompiled !
